# Rust

Using this command installing rust and all of its tools is really easy. Just don't forget to add `.cargo` to your PATH. Most likely you'll also want to install a complete rust toolchain.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
# Install a complete toolchain
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```
